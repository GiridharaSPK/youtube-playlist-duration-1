# YouTube Playlist Duration
Unfortunately, YouTube sometimes removes very useful features; one such being a counter that displays the total duration of a playlist. This extension unobtrusively restores the total duration feature for playlists.

## Features
<ul>
<li>Works for playlists consisting of more than 100 videos. Click the "Load More" to refresh the counter.</li>
<li>Unobtrusive positioning. Click on duration box to hide it.</li>
</ul>

## Known Issues
<ul>
<li>Sometimes, the page must be refreshed for the duration counter to update. This is due to YouTube's recent redesign using Polymer.</li>
 <li>Extension may not work due to other pre-installed ad-blockers.</li>
 <li>Try restarting Chrome if the extension doesn't load.</li>
</ul>
